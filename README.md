Information Gathering
---------------------
* [DNSEnum](https://github.com/fwaeytens/dnsenum)

    multithreaded perl script to enumerate DNS information of a domain and to discover non-contiguous ip blocks.
    There is also a [bash version](https://github.com/theMiddleBlue/DNSenum) of the same tool, that works great and could be    combined with shodan.
