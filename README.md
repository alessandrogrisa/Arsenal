*This repository is just an archive of tools used both in CTF challenges and daily use.*

--------------

Information Gathering
---------------------
* [DNSEnum](https://github.com/fwaeytens/dnsenum)

    Multithreaded perl script to enumerate DNS information of a domain and to discover non-contiguous ip blocks.
    There is also a [bash version](https://github.com/theMiddleBlue/DNSenum) of the same tool, that works great and could be    combined with shodan.    

Discovery
---------------------
* [GoBuster](https://github.com/OJ/gobuster)

    A directory, files and also DNS brute-forcer written in go. 

Web Services
---------------------
* [JS Beautifier Online](https://www.cleancss.com/javascript-beautify/)

    A simple webb app that unminifies and beautifies js and html codes. It works very well, probably one of the best out there.
    It offers also many other services, such as formatters, encoders, hash generators and so on.

Steganography
---------------------
* [Stegsolve](http://www.caesum.com/handbook/stego.htm)
   
    Java tool that tries different renditions of image in order to reveal something hidden. ([direct download](http://www.caesum.com/handbook/Stegsolve.jar)).
